Let n be a natural number, n ≤ 8. Consider the following equation:

xn + cn-1xn-1 + cn-2xn-2 + … + c1x + c0 = 0

where cn-1, cn-2, …, c1, c0 are integers and c0 ≠ 0.

It is known that all the n roots of the equation are real numbers. We consider that each root r of the equation satisfies the condition: -10 ≤ r ≤ 10. Also, there might be roots that appear more than once.

Find the number of irrational roots of the equation (an irrational root is a root that is an irrational number).
